# Parameterized FIR Filter using Python and Verilog

This project implements a **FIR (Finite Impulse Response) low-pass filter** using a parametrized design in both **Python** and **Verilog**. The filter is designed to provide an efficient solution for digital signal processing applications. The code is designed to be easily adjustable for different cutoff frequencies, filter sizes, and resolutions.

## Python Script

The FIR filter coefficients are calculated using the sinc function, with a Hamming window applied to reduce the ripple in the frequency response. The project generates both decimal and hexadecimal coefficients for use in hardware, such as in Verilog descriptions.

### Features:
- **FIR Coefficient Generation**: Coefficients are calculated for a low-pass FIR filter.
- **Hamming Window**: Frequency response improvement by applying a Hamming window.
- **Hardware Scaling**: Coefficients are scaled to an appropriate range for 16-bit representations.
- **Visualization**: Graphing of the filter coefficients and frequency response (magnitude in dB and phase).
- **File Generation**: Scaled coefficients are saved in hexadecimal format for use in Verilog.

## Verilog Code

The Verilog implementation of the FIR filter is parameterized and allows customization for the number of coefficients and the bit-width of the input and output data.

### Verilog Module Overview

The `fir_param` module implements a parameterized FIR filter with the following key features:

- **Parameters**:
  - `NBits`: Specifies the bit-width for the input and output data (default is 16 bits).
  - `NCoeff`: Defines the number of coefficients (taps) in the FIR filter (default is 8).
  
- **Inputs**:
  - `data_in`: The input data signal.
  - `rst`: Reset signal to initialize the filter and clear registers.
  - `clk`: Clock signal for synchronization.
  
- **Outputs**:
  - `data_out`: The output data signal, which is the filtered result.

- **Coefficient Initialization**:
   The coefficients are initialized from a file containing the hexadecimal values, generated by the Python script.
